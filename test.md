  - Users can add products by clicking a **"+" icon**.
  - Each product entry has an **auto-incremented number**.
  - Users can delete a product entry using an **"x icon"**, and the numbering adjusts automatically.
  - The maximum number of products is **5**. After reaching the limit:
    - The **"+" icon** should be hidden.
    - A notification should appear: **"Anda Sudah Mencapai Maksimum Input"**.

#### **2. Product Categories**

#### **3. Image Upload for Categories**
- **Features**:
  - Users can upload images in each category.
  - Supported file types: **JPG, JPEG, PNG**.
